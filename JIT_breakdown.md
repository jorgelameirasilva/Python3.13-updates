## Traditional Python (Without JIT)

Think of Python running your code like a translator reading a book out loud:

1. **Reading Phase**
   - Python reads your code file (like opening a book)
   - Checks if the code makes sense (like checking grammar)
   - Converts it to simple instructions it can understand (like making notes)

2. **Running Phase**
   - Follows the instructions one by one
   - Does exactly what each instruction says
   - Never tries to make things faster while running

Example: 

```python 
Your code
for i in range(1000):
    result = i 2
```

Python runs this the same way every time
Even if it's done it 999 times before!

## New Python 3.13 (With JIT)

Now imagine a smart translator that learns while reading:

1. **Starting Out**
   - Starts just like traditional Python
   - But watches for code that's used a lot

2. **Getting Smarter**
   - When it sees code running many times, it thinks:
   "Hey, I can make this faster!"
   - Takes that code and creates a special, faster version
   - Uses the faster version next time

Example:

First few times: runs normally

```python
for i in range(1000000):
    result = i 2
```
After seeing this loop run many times:
"I'll make a super-fast version just for this!"


## The Big Differences

### Traditional Python
- ✅ Starts running immediately
- ✅ Uses less memory
- ❌ Always runs at the same speed
- ❌ Can be slower for repeated tasks

### Python with JIT
- ✅ Gets faster over time
- ✅ Really good for math and loops
- ❌ Takes a moment to warm up
- ❌ Uses more memory

## When to Use JIT?

### Good Times to Use JIT:
- Number crunching (like our matrix multiplication example)
- Long-running programs
- Lots of loops and calculations

### Maybe Skip JIT When:
- Running short scripts
- Doing simple file operations
- Just reading/writing data

## Real-World Example

Think about making coffee:

**Traditional Python** is like following a recipe step-by-step, every single time.

**JIT Python** is like a barista who:
1. Starts by following the recipe
2. Notices they're making lots of lattes
3. Sets up everything for making lattes quickly
4. Now makes lattes much faster!
